# Spec Creator CLI

A Python command-line tool that leverages **Azure AI Foundry** agents to interactively interview users and generate detailed software specification files (`spec.md`).

## Features

- 🤖 **AI Product Manager**: Uses Azure AI Agents (powered by GPT-5) to conduct a requirement gathering interview.
- 📝 **Automatic Generation**: Extracts a structured `spec.md` file from the conversation once requirements are clear.
- 🧹 **Automatic Cleanup**: Handles agent creation and deletion automatically to keep your Azure project clean.
- 🖥️ **Rich Terminal UI**: Built with `rich` for a beautiful command-line experience.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- An Azure subscription
- An active project in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/spec-creator.git
    cd spec-creator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

1.  Copy the sample environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.sample .env
    # On Windows PowerShell: copy .env.sample .env
    ```

2.  Open `.env` and configure your Azure settings:
    ```ini
    # Get this from your Azure AI Foundry Project Settings -> Management Center
    PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<your-resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<your-project-id>"
    ```

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

1.  The Agent will greet you and ask what you want to build.
2.  Engage in the conversation (define user personas, flows, requirements).
3.  When the Agent has enough information, it will generate the specification.
4.  The result will be saved to `spec.md` in the current directory.
